Using Python 2.7 as the Project Interpreter, Because of unavailability of Python connector for 3.6

Download the python connector for 2.7 from the mysql website.
Make sure you have the mysql for your OS downloaded.
Mysql for windows has a workbench that is like a IDE for Mysql development.
While installing you would enter a master password be sure to save it.
Mysql_connector class acts as an interface for connecting to the mysql server.
The connection setting are in the config file and the settings will change for your system.(Ping me to get the sample config.py file)

1) Try restarting mysql service if you have any issue with logging in.
